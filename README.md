- /datasets - includes a zipped dataset file 'main_dat.zip' and demo images of the synthetic dataset proposed in the paper
- /train - contains the training scripts used to train the different models in the paper - frameworks were used to train these modles, as such we have just provided the config scripts where mm_yolo and mm_det frameworks were used.
